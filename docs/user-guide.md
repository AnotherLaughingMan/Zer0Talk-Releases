## About Peer-to-Peer Networking

Zer0Talk uses peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, which means your messages are sent directly between users without going through a central server. This has important implications:

- **Decentralized**: There is no centralized server that stores your messages, monitors your communications, or manages user accounts
- **Direct Communication**: Messages travel directly from your device to your contact's device through the P2P network
- **No Service Provider**: Zer0Talk is software, not a service - we do not operate servers or infrastructure that handles your data
- **User Responsibility**: Because there is no central authority, users are solely responsible for their own use of Zer0Talk and any communications made through it

**Important Disclaimer**: Zer0Talk cannot be held responsible for how users choose to use the software, what content they share, or any consequences arising from peer-to-peer communications.

## Relay Fallback, Federation, and Privacy

Relays in Zer0Talk are a **connectivity fallback**, not a central message service.

- **Direct first, relay second:** Clients try direct/NAT traversal paths first. Relay is used only when direct paths fail.
- **Still decentralized:** There is no global central server controlling identities, accounts, or message history.
- **Federated by design:** Multiple relay operators can run independent relays, and relay deployments can be federated instead of relying on a single authority.
- **No user-content storage on relay:** Relay forwards encrypted traffic and keeps short-lived routing/coordination state only (for pairing and delivery flow).
- **No private keys on relay:** Private keys remain on client devices; relays never receive or display them.

In short: relays improve reliability in difficult networks while preserving the decentralized trust model.

## Getting Started

1. Install Zer0Talk using the installer or extract the standalone zip.
2. Launch `Zer0Talk.exe` from the Start Menu or extracted folder.
3. On first run, follow the Initial Setup wizard to create your identity.

## Creating an Identity

When launching Zer0Talk for the first time you will be prompted to create your identity.


- Username: Your unique username for the Zer0Talk network.
- Display Name: The name shown to your contacts.
- Passphrase: Automatically generated by Zer0Talk to protect your settings and enable identity recovery.

Tips:
- Choose a memorable username as this helps identify you to other users.
- Your display name can be changed later, but your username becomes part of your identity.
- The passphrase is generated automatically and you'll be given a chance to save it. Save it to an offline device as the safest method - never store it in the same folder as Zer0Talk or in the APPDATA path for Zer0Talk.

## Adding Contacts

There is one way to add a contact:

### Adding by UID or Invitation
- Use the Add Contact toolbar button (icon with tooltip "Add Contact") in the main window to open the Add Contact dialog.
- **Option A**: Enter your contact's Zer0Talk ID (peer UID) directly and send the request.
- **Option B**: If someone who has your UID sends you a contact request, you simply accept their incoming request - no need to enter any information.

- Display Name: The name shown to your contacts.
- Passphrase (optional): A local passphrase used to protect certain settings and enable identity recovery.

Tips:
- Use a memorable passphrase if you expect to move settings across devices.
- If you skip the passphrase, your identity will still be generated but may be harder to recover.

## Adding Contacts

There are two ways to add a contact:

### 1) Send/Receive Contact Request
- Use the Add Contact toolbar button (icon with tooltip "Add Contact") in the main window to open the Add Contact dialog.
- Enter your contact's Zer0Talk ID (peer UID) directly and send the request.
- Your contact will receive the request and can accept to add you back.

### 2) Receive an Invitation Link or QR Code
- If someone shares a Zer0Talk invitation (link or QR), click "Import Invitation" in the Add Contact dialog and paste the link or scan the QR code.
- Confirm the import and optionally provide a local alias.

Notes:
- Contact requests are mutual: the remote user must accept your request before they're added to your list.
- Verification badges appear when a contact shares a verified identity or when you've manually verified them.
- Manual verification is available through the contact's profile menu.

## Deleting Contacts

To delete a contact from your list:
1. Right-click the contact in the contact list.
2. Select the menu item labeled "Remove contact".
3. You will be prompted whether to also erase local message history for this contact.
4. Confirm to remove the contact locally. The other party is not automatically notified.

Notes on data removal:
- If you choose to erase message history, Zer0Talk will attempt a secure wipe of local storage. The speed and method may vary depending on your drive type (SSD vs. HDD).
- Deleting a contact does not revoke any verification tokens or keys the contact may have shared.

## Sending Messages

- Select a contact and type your message into the composer box.
- Press Enter to send, or Ctrl+Enter to insert a newline.

## Message Options

- Edit: Hover over a sent message to reveal the action bar, then click the edit icon. You can only edit a message for 25 minutes after sending - once the timer expires, the message is no longer editable. Edited messages are propagated to recipients.
- Delete: Hover over a message to reveal the action bar, then click the delete icon. This only deletes the message locally - it does not notify the contact or delete the message on their side.
- Burn (Ephemeral): Use the "Burn" option to immediately wipe all messages YOU sent from the conversation after confirming in a dialog. This does not affect any messages on your contact's side.

## Account Deletion

To permanently delete your account and all associated user data:

1. Go to Settings -> Danger Zone
2. Read the helpful instructions provided in the Danger Zone panel carefully
3. In the "Delete Account" section, enter the random phrase shown exactly as displayed
4. Confirm that you wish to delete your account and all user data

**Warning**: This action is irreversible and will permanently remove your identity, contacts, message history, and all other user data from your device. The Danger Zone panel contains important information about this process that you should read and understand before proceeding.

## Themes & Appearance

- Theme selection is in Settings -> Appearance where you can pick a legacy theme or custom theme if you've created one with the Theme Editor
- The Theme Editor is located on the Left Bar of the Main Window - click it to open the Theme Editor:
  - Adjust colors, gradients, and export/import theme files
  - Save themes for sharing

## Notifications & Sounds

- Notification toasts appear for various events and take you to the relevant panel in the Notification Center (Right Panel):
  - Invite notifications take you to the "Pending Invites" view where you can accept or reject invites
  - Unread messages appear in the "Messages" panel
  - General information, warnings, errors, and notices appear in the "Alerts" panel
- DND (Do Not Disturb) mode still holds alerts, messages, and invites in the Notification Center, but silences sounds and doesn't display desktop pop-in notifications.

## Network Port Forwarding (Advanced)

Zer0Talk no longer relies on a dedicated peer-node mode for normal operation. In most setups, you do **not** need manual router port forwarding.

### When to forward port 26264
Only forward port `26264` (or your configured listening port) if **all** of the following are true:
- Your network does not allow automatic UPnP/NAT-PMP mapping (or mapping repeatedly fails).
- You want more inbound direct-connect success and less dependence on relay fallback.
- You are comfortable managing router/firewall rules.

### Why you might forward it
- Improves chance that other peers can initiate direct encrypted sessions to you.
- Can reduce connection setup time in restrictive NAT environments.
- Can reduce relay usage when direct traversal is blocked.

### When you should not forward it
- UPnP is already working and Zer0Talk can map a port automatically.
- You only need standard messaging reliability (relay fallback already covers this case).
- You are on untrusted/public networks where opening inbound ports is undesirable.

### Manual forwarding checklist (only if needed)
1. In your router, forward external TCP `26264` to the Zer0Talk machine's local IP and same port.
2. Ensure Windows Firewall allows Zer0Talk inbound TCP on that port.
3. Keep your local Zer0Talk listening port aligned with the forwarded port.
4. Re-test direct connectivity in the app diagnostics/monitoring view.

## Backup and Restore

- Export settings and identity via Settings -> Danger Zone.
- Backup files store your user data securely.
- To restore on another device: copy your exported data to the APPDATA/Roaming/Zer0Talk folder, start Zer0Talk, and enter your saved passphrase.


## Troubleshooting

- No connection: Ensure at least one node or peer is online, and check firewall/router settings.
- Messages not delivering: Check peer availability and logs in the app's diagnostics panel.
- Audio not playing: Confirm sound files exist in `Assets/Sounds` and system volume settings. Additionally, sounds might lag on first play because they haven't been cached by the App yet, so you may hear delays in the audio at first.
- Install or launch blocked by Windows: open the dedicated guide at `docs/install-run-troubleshooting.md` and follow the SmartScreen steps.
