## About Peer-to-Peer Networking

Zer0Talk uses peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, which means your messages are sent directly between users without going through a central server. This has important implications:

- **Decentralized**: There is no centralized server that stores your messages, monitors your communications, or manages user accounts
- **Direct Communication**: Messages travel directly from your device to your contact's device through the P2P network
- **No Service Provider**: Zer0Talk is software, not a service - we do not operate servers or infrastructure that handles your data
- **User Responsibility**: Because there is no central authority, users are solely responsible for their own use of Zer0Talk and any communications made through it

**Important Disclaimer**: Zer0Talk cannot be held responsible for how users choose to use the software, what content they share, or any consequences arising from peer-to-peer communications.

## Getting Started

1. Install Zer0Talk using the installer or extract the standalone zip.
2. Launch `Zer0Talk.exe` from the Start Menu or extracted folder.
3. On first run, follow the Initial Setup wizard to create your identity.

## Creating an Identity

When launching Zer0Talk for the first time you will be prompted to create your identity.


- Username: Your unique username for the Zer0Talk network.
- Display Name: The name shown to your contacts.
- Passphrase: Automatically generated by Zer0Talk to protect your settings and enable identity recovery.

Tips:
- Choose a memorable username as this helps identify you to other users.
- Your display name can be changed later, but your username becomes part of your identity.
- The passphrase is generated automatically and you'll be given a chance to save it. Save it to an offline device as the safest method - never store it in the same folder as Zer0Talk or in the APPDATA path for Zer0Talk.

## Adding Contacts

There is one way to add a contact:

### Adding by UID or Invitation
- Use the Add Contact toolbar button (icon with tooltip "Add Contact") in the main window to open the Add Contact dialog.
- **Option A**: Enter your contact's Zer0Talk ID (peer UID) directly and send the request.
- **Option B**: If someone who has your UID sends you a contact request, you simply accept their incoming request - no need to enter any information.

- Display Name: The name shown to your contacts.
- Passphrase (optional): A local passphrase used to protect certain settings and enable identity recovery.

Tips:
- Use a memorable passphrase if you expect to move settings across devices.
- If you skip the passphrase, your identity will still be generated but may be harder to recover.

## Adding Contacts

There are two ways to add a contact:

### 1) Send/Receive Contact Request
- Use the Add Contact toolbar button (icon with tooltip "Add Contact") in the main window to open the Add Contact dialog.
- Enter your contact's Zer0Talk ID (peer UID) directly and send the request.
- Your contact will receive the request and can accept to add you back.

### 2) Receive an Invitation Link or QR Code
- If someone shares a Zer0Talk invitation (link or QR), click "Import Invitation" in the Add Contact dialog and paste the link or scan the QR code.
- Confirm the import and optionally provide a local alias.

Notes:
- Contact requests are mutual: the remote user must accept your request before they're added to your list.
- Verification badges appear when a contact shares a verified identity or when you've manually verified them.
- Manual verification is available through the contact's profile menu.

## Deleting Contacts

To delete a contact from your list:
1. Right-click the contact in the contact list.
2. Select the menu item labeled "Remove contact".
3. You will be prompted whether to also erase local message history for this contact.
4. Confirm to remove the contact locally. The other party is not automatically notified.

Notes on data removal:
- If you choose to erase message history, Zer0Talk will attempt a secure wipe of local storage. The speed and method may vary depending on your drive type (SSD vs. HDD).
- Deleting a contact does not revoke any verification tokens or keys the contact may have shared.

## Sending Messages

- Select a contact and type your message into the composer box.
- Press Enter to send, or Ctrl+Enter to insert a newline.

## Message Options

- Edit: Hover over a sent message to reveal the action bar, then click the edit icon. You can only edit a message for 25 minutes after sending - once the timer expires, the message is no longer editable. Edited messages are propagated to recipients.
- Delete: Hover over a message to reveal the action bar, then click the delete icon. This only deletes the message locally - it does not notify the contact or delete the message on their side.
- Burn (Ephemeral): Use the "Burn" option to immediately wipe all messages YOU sent from the conversation after confirming in a dialog. This does not affect any messages on your contact's side.

## Account Deletion

To permanently delete your account and all associated user data:

1. Go to Settings -> Danger Zone
2. Read the helpful instructions provided in the Danger Zone panel carefully
3. In the "Delete Account" section, enter the random phrase shown exactly as displayed
4. Confirm that you wish to delete your account and all user data

**Warning**: This action is irreversible and will permanently remove your identity, contacts, message history, and all other user data from your device. The Danger Zone panel contains important information about this process that you should read and understand before proceeding.

## Themes & Appearance

- Theme selection is in Settings -> Appearance where you can pick a legacy theme or custom theme if you've created one with the Theme Editor
- The Theme Editor is located on the Left Bar of the Main Window - click it to open the Theme Editor:
  - Adjust colors, gradients, and export/import theme files
  - Save themes for sharing

## Notifications & Sounds

- Notification toasts appear for various events and take you to the relevant panel in the Notification Center (Right Panel):
  - Invite notifications take you to the "Pending Invites" view where you can accept or reject invites
  - Unread messages appear in the "Messages" panel
  - General information, warnings, errors, and notices appear in the "Alerts" panel
- DND (Do Not Disturb) mode still holds alerts, messages, and invites in the Notification Center, but silences sounds and doesn't display desktop pop-in notifications.

## Running a Dedicated Node (Advanced)

A Dedicated Peer Node improves the P2P Network stability by being an always-on peer. You have to leave your client running in the System Tray (enabling the System tray features that are currently broken). By being a Dedicated Peer Node you contribute to the global Zer0Talk Network by being a stable peer. This is optional and intended for advanced users.

### Intended Use Cases
- Improve message delivery when your client is offline
- Provide a stable public endpoint for NAT traversal and rendezvous

### Requirements
- An always-on high-speed connection with no data limit
- Keep your Zer0Talk client running in the background
- Forward your ports on your router/firewall
- Ensure Windows Firewall isn't blocking Zer0Talk

### Quick Setup
1. In the app Settings -> Network toggle the "Enable as dedicated peer node" option.
2. Forward port 26264 (or your chosen port) on your router/firewall.
3. Ensure Windows Firewall allows Zer0Talk through.
4. Keep your Zer0Talk client running in the background.

## Backup and Restore

- Export settings and identity via Settings -> Danger Zone.
- Backup files store your user data securely.
- To restore on another device: copy your exported data to the APPDATA/Roaming/Zer0Talk folder, start Zer0Talk, and enter your saved passphrase.


## Troubleshooting

- No connection: Ensure at least one node or peer is online, and check firewall/router settings.
- Messages not delivering: Check peer availability and logs in the app's diagnostics panel.
- Audio not playing: Confirm sound files exist in `Assets/Sounds` and system volume settings. Additionally, sounds might lag on first play because they haven't been cached by the App yet, so you may hear delays in the audio at first.
