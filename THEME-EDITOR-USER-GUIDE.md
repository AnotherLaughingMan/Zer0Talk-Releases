## Editing Colors

### How to Edit a Color

1. Find the color in the **🎨 Color Overrides** section
2. You'll see a friendly name like **"Main Background"** with the technical name below in small text
3. The hex value is displayed as read-only in the Color Overrides panel
4. Click the **color preview square** (40x40 colored box) to open the color picker
5. The visual color picker popup opens with multiple ways to edit:
   - **Hex field**: Type the new hex color code (e.g., `#2A2A2A`)
   - **Visual picker**: Drag on the large saturation/value square
   - **Sliders**: Adjust Hue, Saturation, Value, and Alpha sliders
   - **RGB inputs**: Type exact Red, Green, Blue values (0-255)
6. Click **Apply** to save your changes, or **Cancel** to discard

### Color Format Guide

Colors use hexadecimal (hex) format:

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `#RRGGBB` | `#FF0000` | Standard format (Red, Green, Blue) |
| `#RGB` | `#F00` | Short format (automatically expands) |

**Examples:**
- `#1C1C1C` - Dark grey (good for backgrounds)
- `#FFFFFF` - White (for text)
- `#FF6B6B` - Warm red (for accents)
- `#4FACFE` - Bright blue

**Quick Tips:**
- Colors must start with `#`
- Use 3 or 6 characters after the `#`
- Valid characters: 0-9, A-F

### Understanding Color Names

Instead of cryptic codes like "App.Background", you'll see clear names:

- **Main Background** - The main window background
- **Accent Color (Primary Highlight)** - Buttons, links, highlights
- **Text on Background** - Main text color
- **Border/Separator Lines** - Dividers and borders
- **Button Background** - Default button color
- **Success/Confirmation Color** - Success messages
- And many more...

The technical name (like `App.Background`) appears below in small grey text for reference.

## Working with Gradients

### What Are Gradients?

Gradients are smooth color transitions that add depth and visual interest. For example, the title bar can fade from dark blue at the top to lighter blue at the bottom.

### Finding Gradients

Scroll down to the **🌈 Gradients** section. You'll see gradients with friendly names:

- **Title Bar Gradient** - The top bar of Zer0Talk windows

### Editing a Gradient

**Step 1: Click Edit**
1. Find the gradient you want to customize
2. Click the **✏️ Edit** button
3. The gradient editor expands

**Step 2: Choose Your Method**

**Option A: Use a Preset (Quick but Sometimes Quirky)**
1. Scroll down to **Apply Preset** ComboBox
2. Click the dropdown to see preset options with visual previews
3. Choose from 6 beautiful presets:
   - **Sunset** - Warm red to yellow (135° angle)
   - **Ocean** - Cool blue to cyan (180° angle)
   - **Forest** - Green to teal (90° angle)
   - **Purple Haze** - Purple to pink (45° angle)
   - **Fire** - Bold red to orange (0° angle)
   - **Ice** - Soft blue gradient (270° angle)
4. Each preset shows a preview bar with the gradient colors
5. Selecting a preset should automatically fill in the Start Color, End Color, and Angle fields

**Note**: The preset feature is currently semi-working with some quirks. If a preset doesn't apply correctly, try selecting it again or manually enter the colors using Option B below.

**Option B: Type Custom Colors**
1. **Start Color**: Type a hex color (e.g., `#FF6B6B`) or click the color square to use the color picker
2. **End Color**: Type a hex color (e.g., `#FFD93D`) or click the color square to use the color picker
3. **Angle**: Type 0-360
   - `0°` = Left to right (Start to End)
   - `90°` = Bottom to top
   - `180°` = Right to left
   - `270°` = Top to bottom

**Note**: Unlike Color Overrides, gradient hex values can still be edited directly, though using the color picker is recommended for better accuracy.

**Step 3: Save**
- Click **💾 Save** to apply the gradient
- Click **❌ Cancel** to discard changes

### Removing a Gradient

Want a solid color instead of a gradient? Use the **Clear Gradient** button:

1. Click **✏️ Edit** on the gradient
2. Click **🧹 Clear Gradient** button
3. Both Start and End colors are set to your theme's Main Background color
4. This creates a "flat" look (no gradient visible)
5. Click **💾 Save**

**Why Clear Instead of Delete?**
Setting both colors the same is simpler than complex on/off settings. You can always add the gradient back by changing the colors again.

### Gradient Direction Guide

The **Angle** controls which way the gradient flows:

```
    270° (Top → Bottom)
       ↓
       
180° ← ■ → 0° (Left ↔ Right)
       
       ↑
     90° (Bottom → Top)
```

**Common Angles:**
- **0°** - Dynamic left-to-right sweep (Start to End)
- **90°** - Bottom-to-top rise (upward energy)
- **270°** - Subtle top-to-bottom fade (most natural)
- **45°** or **135°** - Diagonal energy
- **180°** - Right-to-left (reversed feel)

**Important Note**: Gradient visibility depends heavily on your color choices. Acute and obtuse angles (like 30°, 45°, 135°, 150°) may be barely noticeable with similar colors but very dramatic with contrasting colors. High-contrast gradients make any angle direction obvious, while subtle color transitions work best with angles that match your UI flow (0° for horizontal elements, 270° for vertical elements).

## Creating Custom Themes

### Starting from the Blank Template

The easiest way to create a custom theme is to start with the Blank Template:

   - Then **Text on Background** (for readability)
   - Then **Accent Color** (for personality)
   - Then customize the rest as desired
4. Edit the **Title Bar Gradient**:
   - Use a preset for quick results
   - Or create custom colors
   - Or clear it for a solid title bar
5. Click **💾 Save As** when done
6. Name your theme (e.g., "My Dark Blue Theme")
7. Choose where to save the .zttheme file

**Your theme is created!** You can now import it anytime.

## Tips & Best Practices

### Creating Great Color Schemes

**Start with a Base Color:**
1. Choose your Main Background color first
2. This sets the mood (dark, light, warm, cool)
3. Build other colors around it

**Ensure Readability:**
- Text should clearly contrast with backgrounds
- Test with different lighting conditions
- Dark text on light backgrounds OR light text on dark backgrounds
- Avoid low-contrast combinations (grey on grey)

**Use Accent Colors Sparingly:**
- Pick ONE main accent color
- Use it for buttons, links, highlights
- Too many bright colors = visual chaos

**Test Your Theme:**
- Use it for a few hours before finalizing
- Check it during daytime and nighttime
- Make sure chat messages are readable
- Ensure buttons are clearly visible

### Gradient Best Practices

**Subtle is Usually Better:**
- Use similar colors for a professional look
- Example: `#2A2A2A` → `#1C1C1C` (subtle dark grey)
- Avoid extreme contrasts unless intentional

**Match Your Theme:**
- If your theme is cool (blues), use cool gradients
- If your theme is warm (reds/oranges), use warm gradients
- Consistency = polish

**When to Use Gradients:**
- Title bars (adds depth without distraction)
- Large background areas
- Special UI elements you want to highlight

**When to Skip Gradients:**
- Minimalist themes (use Clear Gradient)
- High-contrast themes
- When you prefer flat design

### Individual Color Editing Workflow

**Quick Individual Color Editing:**
1. Click the color preview square to open the visual color picker
2. Adjust using the saturation/value picker or sliders
3. Type exact hex codes in the hex field within the color picker popup
4. Click **Apply** to save

**Copy/Paste Individual Colors:**
- Click the **copy icon** next to any color to copy it
- Click the **paste icon** next to another color to apply the copied color
- Great for creating consistent color schemes

### Version Your Themes

**Save Iterations:**
- `my-theme-v1.zttheme` - First version
- `my-theme-v2.zttheme` - After tweaks
- `my-theme-final.zttheme` - Polished version

**Why Version:**
- Go back to earlier versions if needed
- Try experimental changes safely
- Track your evolution as a designer

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Color format is invalid"

**Problem:** Entered a color but got an error

**Solution:**
- Make sure it starts with `#`
- Use only 3 or 6 characters after the `#`
- Valid characters: 0-9, A-F
- Examples: `#FFF` or `#FFFFFF` (both work)

### Gradient Preset ComboBox Behavior

**Problem:** After selecting a preset, the ComboBox selection clears

**This is Normal:** The ComboBox resets after applying a preset so you can select another one.

**What's Happening:**
- The preset colors ARE being applied to the Start Color, End Color, and Angle fields
- You can see the gradient preview update in the UI
- The ComboBox clears to allow selecting the same or different preset again
- This is standard behavior for action-based ComboBoxes

### Theme Doesn't Look Right After Import

**Check:**
1. Make sure you imported the correct file
2. Verify the file wasn't corrupted during transfer
3. Try opening the .zttheme file in a text editor to check it's valid JSON
4. Re-export from the source if needed

### Want to Reset to Default

**Two Options:**

**Option 1: Reload Built-in Theme**
1. Close Theme Editor
2. Click the **🎨 Theme Editor** icon in the left sidebar to reopen
3. Click **📁 Import Theme** and load a different theme

**Option 2: Start Fresh**
1. Click **📄 New from Blank**
2. Start over with neutral colors

## Editing Gradients

Gradients add beautiful color transitions to UI elements like the title bar, backgrounds, and buttons. The Theme Editor makes it easy to customize these gradients with a visual editor and ready-made presets.

### What Are Gradients?

Gradients are smooth color transitions that can make your theme look more dynamic and professional. For example:
- **Title Bar**: A gradient from dark blue to light blue creates depth
- **Buttons**: A subtle gradient can make buttons feel more clickable
- **Backgrounds**: Gradients add visual interest without being distracting

### Where Gradients Appear in Your Theme

When you open the Theme Editor, scroll down to the **🌈 Gradients** section. You'll see a list of available gradients with user-friendly names:

- **Title Bar Gradient** - The top bar of Zer0Talk windows

Each gradient shows its friendly name (like "Title Bar Gradient") with the technical resource key below in small text (like "App.TitleBarBackground").

### Customizing the Title Bar Gradient (Quick Start)

Let's customize the title bar gradient as an example. The same steps work for any gradient.

**Step 1: Find the Gradient**
1. Open Theme Editor (click **🎨 Theme Editor** icon in left sidebar)
2. Scroll down to **🌈 Gradients** section
3. Look for **Title Bar Gradient**
   - Below it you'll see the resource key: `App.TitleBarBackground`

**Step 2: Start Editing**
1. Click the **✏️ Edit** button next to Title Bar Gradient
2. The gradient editor expands showing:
   - Start Color (where the gradient begins)
   - End Color (where it ends)
   - Angle field (direction of the gradient)
   - Quick preset options

**Step 3: Change the Colors**

You have two ways to customize:

**Option A: Type Color Codes**
- **Start Color**: Type a hex color like `#FF6B6B` (warm red)
- **End Color**: Type a hex color like `#FFD93D` (warm yellow)
- The gradient updates as you type

**Option B: Use Quick Presets**
1. Click the **Preset dropdown**
2. Choose from beautiful ready-made gradients:
   - **Sunset**: Warm red to yellow (perfect for title bars)
   - **Ocean**: Cool blue to cyan
   - **Forest**: Green to teal
   - **Purple Haze**: Purple to pink
   - **Fire**: Bold red to orange
   - **Ice**: Soft blue gradient
3. The dropdown shows a preview of each gradient
4. Colors automatically fill in when you select one

**Step 4: Adjust the Direction**
- Type in the **Angle field** to change gradient direction:
  - **0°** = Left to right (horizontal, Start to End)
  - **90°** = Bottom to top
  - **180°** = Right to left
  - **270°** = Top to bottom
- The gradient updates when you save

**Step 5: Save Your Changes**
- Click **💾 Save** to apply the gradient
- Click **❌ Cancel** to discard changes
- Your title bar immediately shows the new gradient!

**💡 Pro Tip**: If you're working on a custom theme that you have actively set on Zer0Talk, saving your theme will live update the theme and you will see the changes immediately throughout the application.

### Gradient Tips & Tricks

**Creating Subtle Gradients**:
- Use similar colors (e.g., `#2A2A2A` to `#1C1C1C`)
- Keep the angle at 90° or 180° for smooth transitions
- Perfect for professional-looking themes

**Creating Bold Gradients**:
- Use contrasting colors (e.g., `#FF0844` to `#FFBC0D`)
- Try diagonal angles like 45° or 135°
- Great for eye-catching themes

**Matching Your Brand**:
- Use your brand colors for Start/End
- Keep the angle consistent across gradients
- Creates a cohesive look

**Testing Gradients**:
- The gradient applies immediately when you save
- Look at the title bar to see how it looks
- You can always edit again if you want to adjust

### Quick Preset Reference

| Preset Name | Colors | Best For |
|------------|--------|----------|
| **Sunset** | Red → Yellow | Warm, energetic themes |
| **Ocean** | Blue → Cyan | Cool, professional themes |
| **Forest** | Green → Teal | Natural, calming themes |
| **Purple Haze** | Purple → Pink | Creative, modern themes |
| **Fire** | Red → Orange | Bold, attention-grabbing themes |
| **Ice** | Light Blue → Lighter Blue | Subtle, minimalist themes |

### What If I Don't See Any Gradients?

**Blank Template**: Now includes a default neutral grey gradient for the Title Bar that you can customize.

**Other Themes**: Some minimal themes might not have gradients defined. To add gradients:
1. Start with the Blank Template (has Title Bar gradient)
2. Or import a theme that has gradients
3. Customize the gradients to your liking
4. Export your modified theme

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I remove a gradient and use a solid color instead?**
A: Yes! Just set the Start Color and End Color to the same value. For example, both `#2A2A2A` creates a solid dark grey.

**Q: How do I make the gradient go from left to right?**
A: Set the Angle to **0°** (this is the default Start to End direction).

**Q: Can I add more gradients?**
A: Currently, you can edit the gradients that come with the theme. Support for adding new gradients will come in a future update.

**Q: What's the difference between 0° and 180°?**
A: They go in opposite directions:
- **0°**: Start color at left, End color at right
- **180°**: Start color at right, End color at left

## Creating Custom Themes from Blank Template

The **Blank Template** feature allows you to create themes from scratch with neutral colors.

### What is the Blank Template?

The blank template is a built-in theme with:
- **21 neutral grey colors** - A clean slate for customization
- **1 neutral gradient** (Title Bar) - Ready to customize with your colors
- **Read-only protection** - Must use "Save As" to create custom theme
- **Tags**: ["template", "built-in"]

This gives you a professional starting point where you can focus on adding your own colors and style.

### Creating a Custom Theme

**Step 1: Load Blank Template**
1. Open Theme Editor (click **🎨 Theme Editor** icon in left sidebar)
2. Click **📄 New from Blank** button
3. Template loads into editor with 21 grey colors
4. Orange badge appears: "🔒 Built-in Theme (Read-Only)"
5. Toast notification: "📄 Blank template loaded - Start customizing!"

**Step 2: Customize Colors**
1. Edit individual colors (see [Editing Colors](#editing-colors) section)
2. Use Recent Colors and Copy/Paste for consistency
3. All edits are tracked in undo/redo stack

**Step 3: Optionally Edit Metadata**
1. Click **✏️ Edit Metadata** button
2. Set Display Name (required): e.g., "My Dark Purple Theme"
3. Add Description: e.g., "Custom purple theme for evening coding"
4. Set Author: Your name
5. Set Version: e.g., "1.0.0"
6. Click **💾 Save**

**Step 4: Save Your Custom Theme**
1. Click **💾 Save As...** button
2. File save dialog appears
3. Enter filename: e.g., `my-purple-theme.zttheme`
4. Choose save location
5. Click **Save**
6. Success toast: "💾 Theme saved as: my-purple-theme.zttheme"

**What's Created**:

- Protects default template from accidental modification

**Custom Themes**:
- Created via "Save As" or "Export Modified"
- Can be edited and re-saved
- No read-only badge
- Full control over all aspects

### Save As vs Export Modified

| Feature | 💾 Save As... | 📤 Export Modified |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Available When** | Always (especially for built-in) | After making edits |
| **Purpose** | Create new custom theme | Save edited version |
| **Creates New ID** | Yes | Yes |

## Tips & Best Practices

### 🎨 Color Selection

**Use Color Theory**:
- Complementary colors for contrast (opposite on color wheel)
- Analogous colors for harmony (adjacent on color wheel)
- Monochromatic schemes for subtle themes

**Accessibility**:
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text (WCAG AA)
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Avoid red/green as sole differentiators

**Consistency**:
- Use similar saturation levels across colors
- Keep lightness consistent within sections
- Use accent color sparingly for emphasis

### 💾 Backup & Version Control

**Before Major Changes**:
1. Export current theme → `mytheme-backup.zttheme`
2. Make edits
3. Export modified → `mytheme-v2.zttheme`
4. Compare by importing each

**Version Naming**:
- Use semantic versioning: `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `2.0.0`
- Increment major version for breaking changes
- Increment minor version for new features
- Increment patch version for fixes

### 🚀 Workflow Optimization

**Use Undo/Redo For**:
- Experimenting with colors
- Comparing variations quickly
- Stepping through design iterations

**Use Recent Colors For**:
- Maintaining color consistency
- Quick access to palette
- Reducing typing errors

### 🎭 Creating Themes From Scratch

**Method 1: Using Blank Template** (Recommended)
1. **Load blank template**: Click **📄 New from Blank** button
2. **Define palette**: Choose 5-8 core colors for your theme
3. **Edit backgrounds**: Start with `App.Background`, `App.Surface`
4. **Edit text colors**: `App.Text`, `App.SecondaryText`
5. **Edit accent color**: `App.Accent`, `App.AccentHover`
6. **Edit borders**: `App.Border`, `App.Divider`
7. **Update metadata**: Name, description, author, version
8. **Save custom theme**: Click **💾 Save As...** to create .zttheme file
9. **Test**: Import and use for 24 hours, adjust as needed
10. **Iterate**: Make changes and export new versions

**Method 2: Modify Existing Theme**
1. **Start with base theme**: Import existing theme similar to goal
2. **Define palette**: Choose 5-8 core colors
3. **Edit backgrounds**: Start with `App.Background`, `App.Surface`
4. **Edit text colors**: `App.Text`, `App.SecondaryText`
5. **Edit accent color**: `App.Accent`, `App.AccentHover`
6. **Edit borders**: `App.Border`, `App.Divider`
7. **Edit gradients**: Title bars, surfaces (if theme has gradients)
8. **Update metadata**: Name, description, author
9. **Export modified**: Click **📤 Export Modified** to save changes
10. **Test**: Import and use for 24 hours, adjust as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Color Won't Save

**Problem**: Click Save but color doesn't update

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Check color format is valid (#RRGGBB)
- ✅ Check for typos in hex code
- ✅ Look for validation toast message
- ✅ Try cancelling and re-editing

### Undo Button Disabled

**Problem**: Can't click Undo button

**Causes**:
- No edits made yet (undo stack empty)
- All edits already undone

**Solution**: Make a new edit first

### Theme Import Failed

**Problem**: "❌ Import failed" toast appears

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Verify file is valid JSON (open in text editor)
- ✅ Check file has `.zttheme` extension
- ✅ Ensure file not corrupted (re-download)
- ✅ Check file size < 5MB
- ✅ Look for specific error in toast message

### Gradient Section Shows "No gradients defined"

**Problem**: Gradient section is empty with message "📋 No gradients defined in this theme"

**This is Normal For**:
- Blank template (has no gradients by design)
- Minimal themes
- Themes you created without gradients

**This is NOT an Error**: Gradients are optional decorative elements. A theme without gradients is perfectly valid.

**To Add Gradients** (Workaround):
1. Import a theme that has gradients (e.g., legacy-dark)
2. Edit the gradient colors to match your theme
3. Export the modified theme
4. You now have a theme with gradients

**Note**: Direct gradient creation will be added in Phase 4.

### Gradient Editor Not Opening

**Problem**: Click Edit but gradient editor doesn't expand

**Causes**:
- Gradient definition is null (no data)
- Another gradient already being edited

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Check "GradientPreview" shows data
- ✅ Cancel other gradient edit first
- ✅ Restart application if stuck

### Metadata Won't Save

**Problem**: "Theme name cannot be empty" error

**Solution**:
- Display Name is required field
- Enter at least 1 character
- Other fields (Description, Version, Author) are optional

### Can't Overwrite Built-in Theme

**Problem**: "Built-in Theme (Read-Only)" badge shown, Export Modified doesn't update theme

**This is Expected Behavior**: The built-in blank template is protected from modification.

**Solution**:
1. Click **💾 Save As...** button instead
2. Create new custom theme with your edits
3. Custom themes can be modified freely
4. Import your custom theme to use it

### Save/Cancel Buttons Greyed Out During Color Edit

**Problem**: Click to edit color but Save/Cancel buttons are disabled

**Root Cause**: This was a known issue that has been fixed. Buttons now properly enable when editing colors.

**If Still Experiencing**:
- ✅ Ensure you're running the latest version
- ✅ Click away from the color field, then back
- ✅ Cancel and start edit again
- ✅ Restart application if persists

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Undo** | `Ctrl+Z` | Undo last color edit |
| **Redo** | `Ctrl+Y` | Redo undone edit |

**Note**: Individual color edits don't have shortcuts. Use toolbar buttons.

## Advanced Topics

### Theme File Structure

A `.zttheme` file is JSON with this structure:

```json
{
  "Id": "custom-20251018143022",
  "DisplayName": "My Custom Theme",
  "Description": "A theme I created",
  "Author": "Your Name",
  "Version": "1.0.0",
  "BaseVariant": "Dark",
  "ColorOverrides": {
    "App.Background": "#1E1E1E",
    "App.Text": "#FFFFFF"
  },
  "Gradients": {
    "TitleBar.Gradient": {
      "StartColor": "#FF6B6B",
      "EndColor": "#FFD93D",
      "Angle": 135.0
    }
  },
  "AllowsCustomization": true,
  "CreatedAt": "2025-10-18T14:30:22Z",
  "ModifiedAt": "2025-10-18T14:30:22Z"
}
```

### Manual Editing

You CAN edit `.zttheme` files manually:
1. Open in text editor
2. Modify JSON carefully
3. Validate JSON syntax
4. Import modified file

**Caution**: Manual editing risks creating invalid themes. Use the Theme Editor when possible.

### Theme Registry

Themes are stored in memory during session:
- Blank template: Built into application
- Custom themes: Loaded from .zttheme files
- Imported themes: Loaded from .zttheme files

**Future Enhancement**: Persistent theme library (Phase 4)
